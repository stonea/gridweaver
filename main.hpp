/*! \mainpage Gridweaver: A compiler for semi-regular grid computations
 *
 * \section sec_intro Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to the documentation for the GridWeaver compiler.  This documentation
 * is useful for people developing GridWeaver (not necessarily for GridWeaver's
 * users.)
 *
 * GridWeaver is an active library for specifying stencil computations on
 * semi-regular grids. Semi-regular grids are meshes consisting of a finite
 * number of regular regions, stored as arrays, that connect to one another in
 * an irregular fashion. With GridWeaver programmers are able to specify grid
 * topology separately from the operations that they wish to apply. GridWeaver
 * uses code generation techniques to replace library calls with more efficient,
 * inlined, code.
 *
 * \section sec_install Installation
 *
 * To install GridWeaver simply execute 'make'.
